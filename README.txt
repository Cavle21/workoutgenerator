Hi!


This is a basic press button workout generator. I'm absolutely new to this and for the most part this is just acting as a practice/ familiarization for git hub and brackets(my editing software).

Its a very basic setup. Not very flashy, I was focusing more on the core basics. Using Jquery to manipulate DOM and using the basic parts of javascript (arrays, objects, variables etc.).


The website welcomes the user and tells them to press the button to get a workout. The computer grabs from an array a random workout and presents the name in a <li>.
